        <title>9 Steps to a Hassle Free and Effective Software Development Project</title>
    </head>
    <body><p>Following these nine steps may be the ultimate secret weapon to<br> winning business and successfully delivering new easy-to-use software that meets and exceeds expectations.</p>
        <h1>Developing a Practical Approach: The Role of the Project Manager</h1>
        <p>When undertaking a software development project, the first element <br>to consider is the establishment of a comprehensive yet practical approach to the initiative that ultimately will lead to a successful end result.</p>
   <h2>Step #1: Conduct Feasibility Analysis</h2>
   <p>According to Dr. Gehrs, a critical first step is to interview stakeholders in order to uncover whether a specific need exists, identify this exact need, and determine whether the proposed project can feasibly deliver the expected software development. "Many times, this is the point at which an ROI study will be carried out in order to determine project costs and benefits," says Dr. Gehrs.</p>
    <h2>Step #2: Analyse and Determine Requirements</h2>
    <p>When it comes to the next step of determining requirements, Dr. Gehrs believes a proper analysis should consist of interviews with end users and others who will be associated with the new software system. In addition, a thorough review and a keen understanding of user documents, business rules, and processes are keys to determining appropriate and necessary features and functionality. This is a valuable and significant step in the development process and the point at which such deliverables as those documents outlining the scope of the project and those detailing the software product requirement will be produced.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Desktops for development with an advanced integrated development environment suite</li>
        <li>A server with a configuration management system for document tracking and version control</li>
        <li>A staging server for integration testing and a production server for deployment of the final product</li>
        <li>A requirement/task/defect tracking tool</li>
        <li>An automated build system</li>
        <li>A regression testing tool</li>
        <li>An automated reporting system</li>
        <li>
        <p>"Investing in the proper infrastructure is essential and will pay back quickly," asserts Dr. Huizinga. There are three key elements the proper infrastructure provides:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>Product and project visibility</li>
           <li>Automation of repetitive and mundane tasks</li>
           <li>Facilitation of collaboration</li>
           
        </ul>
        </li></ol>
